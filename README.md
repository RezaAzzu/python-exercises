# python-exercises
Python codes I made and learnt from the book "Learning Python the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw.
All of the codes are from the book exercises that I made during my freetime. It is not supposed to be used by someone other than hence the lack of comments, but I'll try to explain what each code/chapter do.
